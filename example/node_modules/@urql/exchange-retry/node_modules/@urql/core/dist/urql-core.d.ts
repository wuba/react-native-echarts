/** A GraphQL parse function, which may be called as a tagged template literal, returning a parsed {@link DocumentNode}.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `gql` tag or function is used to parse a GraphQL query document into a {@link DocumentNode}.
 *
 * When used as a tagged template, `gql` will automatically merge fragment definitions into the resulting
 * document and deduplicate them.
 *
 * It enforces that all fragments have a unique name. When fragments with different definitions share a name,
 * it will log a warning in development.
 *
 * Hint: It’s recommended to use this `gql` function over other GraphQL parse functions, since it puts the parsed
 * results directly into `@urql/core`’s internal caches and prevents further unnecessary work.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const AuthorFragment = gql`
 *   fragment AuthorDisplayComponent on Author {
 *     id
 *     name
 *   }
