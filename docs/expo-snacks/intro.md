# Introduction

[Expo Snack](https://snack.expo.dev/) is an open-source platform for running React Native apps in the browser.

To make @wuba/react-native-echarts work in snack, we packaged echarts into @wuba/react-native-echarts and published it under the `all` tag, which you can install by doing the following:

```bash
yarn add @wuba/react-native-echarts@all
```

In practice, it is still recommended that you import echarts from echarts and import the corresponding charts, components as needed.

Next, let's take a look at @wuba/react-native-echarts online.
